--- SportsZone Default ---
Clean and stylish, SportsZone Default lets you build a social network straight out of the box. Make it yours with a custom menu, header image, and background. Along with five widgetized areas (one in the sidebar, four in the footer), BP-Default supports featured images (as custom header images on posts and pages) and is furnished with an optional one-column page template that removes the sidebar, and a stylesheet for the admin Visual Editor.


--- Installation ---
The theme is bundled with SportsZone. After activating the plugin, SportsZone Default will be added to the "Appearance > Themes" menu in your WordPress admin area.
